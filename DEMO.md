# Health Canopy — Demo Guide

**AI-powered hospital inventory intelligence that unifies supply chain visibility across every PAR location, department, and supply chain in your facility.**

## What This App Does

Health Canopy replaces the 3-5 disconnected software systems hospitals use today with a single platform that connects every supply chain — Med/Surg, Pharmacy/ADC, Surgical/OR, and Lab — into one unified view. It combines real-time inventory tracking with AI-powered demand forecasting, Joint Commission compliance monitoring, and automated procurement workflows.

The demo is configured for **Contra Costa Regional Medical Center** (UCSF Contra Costa Healthcare system), a mid-sized community hospital with 4 facilities, 8 departments, 62 PAR locations, and ~18,800 tracked SKUs.

## Pages & What to Show

### 1. Dashboard (`/`)

**The "single pane of glass" for hospital operations.**

- **KPI Row**: Total SKUs (18,812), PAR locations monitored (62 across 4 facilities), active alerts (14, 3 critical), monthly spend vs. budget ($856K, -6.5%)
- **Supply Chain Status Strip**: Real-time fill rates across all 4 parallel supply chains (Med/Surg 91%, Pharmacy/ADC 84%, Surgical/OR 76% — critical, Lab 96%)
- **Items Needing Attention**: Critical/out-of-stock items (Heparin at 23% of PAR, Vicryl sutures critical, ventilator circuits out of stock) plus expiring items
- **Orders Needing Action**: Pending purchase orders with status badges (AI Recommended, Pending Approval, Approved, Submitted, In Transit) — shows supplier, cost, expected delivery
- **Cross-Location Imbalances**: Shows when one floor is hoarding supplies while another runs out. Example: Med/Surg 3E has nitrile gloves at 180% of PAR while ICU is at 42%. Suggested transfer: move 400 units
- **AI Insights**: Top 3 forward-looking alerts with severity coloring — flu surge predicted (CDC data), unusual fentanyl consumption (diversion risk), surgical volume spike
- **Incoming Deliveries**: Delayed shipments with severity indicators, on-track deliveries with tracking timeline status
- **Department Consumption**: Dual bar chart comparing current usage vs. AI-predicted across all departments
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time timeline of actions (stock receipts, AI alerts, compliance events, PO updates)

### 2. Inventory (`/inventory`)

**Every item across every PAR location — searchable, filterable, actionable.**

  - Full item metadata (PAR level, reorder point, unit cost, supplier)
  - **GPO Contract** reference (e.g., "Vizient #MS-2025-441")

## Design System

The app uses a consistent semantic color system:

| Color | Meaning | Used For |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Primary** (terracotta) | Brand / action | Buttons, active states, AI recommendations |
| **Accent** (sage green) | Positive / safe | Baseline scenarios, success states, projected impact |
| **Red** | Danger / urgent | Critical stock, high-severity alerts, flu surge |
| **Amber** | Warning / caution | Low stock, supply disruptions, medium-severity alerts |
| **Stone** | Neutral | Low-priority items, snoozed states, informational |

## Key Talking Points for Stakeholders

1. **Unified view across all supply chains**: One system replaces 3-5 disconnected tools. The supply chain status strip shows Med/Surg, Pharmacy/ADC, Surgical/OR, and Lab chains in one glance.

2. **Cross-location visibility solves hoarding**: The imbalance alerts detect when one floor has excess while another is critical — and suggests specific transfers with quantities.

3. **62 PAR locations monitored**: Every supply room, Pyxis MedStation, Omnicell cabinet, isolation cart, and satellite pharmacy is tracked from one dashboard.

4. **AI-powered demand forecasting**: Consumption predictions combine historical patterns, scheduled procedures, patient census, and CDC surveillance data. The flu surge scenario shows proactive vs. reactive procurement — including real-time signals like the 3x spike in flu vaccination appointments.

5. **Joint Commission always-ready**: Continuous compliance monitoring across all 7 TJC chapters, not just annual audit prep. Equipment PM tracking with AEM documentation.

6. **GPO contract awareness**: Every item shows its GPO contract tier, enabling procurement teams to maximize committed pricing and identify off-contract spend.

7. **What-if scenario planning**: Toggle between normal operations, flu surge, and supply disruption scenarios to see inventory impact and AI-recommended mitigations before problems hit.
